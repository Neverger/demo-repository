# demo-repository
for Google Code-In
This is a readme
To complete this task, I first created the account, verified it and created a new repository.
When creating the repository, I selected the options to add a .gitignore and a license, one for java and the unlicense, respectively.
I then wrote a hello world program, submitted it as a file to the master branch.
I then created a new branch, "second-bar" and edited/updated the helloworld file. 
I then submitted a pull request from second-bar to the master branch.
Finally, I created this readme.
